# Project Title: Sign Language Detection
Description: Our project aims to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard of hearing by developing an advanced system that automatically detects and translates Sign Language using cutting-edge Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Transformer architectures for gesture analysis, we ensure high accuracy and efficiency. The system integrates pre-trained models like signBERT and uses datasets from IndianSignLanguage.org. With a user-friendly interface, it translates recognized signs into text or speech, making it a valuable tool for education, healthcare, and public services. Initial results show promising accuracy and reliability, paving the way for real-world applications.
